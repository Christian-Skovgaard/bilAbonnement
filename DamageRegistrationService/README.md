# Damage Registration Service

## Description
This microservice is part of the [microsystem network](https://github.com/Christian-Skovgaard/bilAbonnement) developed by Team SAFers as part of the EK ITA 3rd semester autumn exam 2025. The system stands as an MVP for a potential internal system for Bilabonnement.dk in an effort to make them more data driven and effective.

The purpose of this service is to view, create, edit, and delete damage reports of a given registration number of an arbitrary car in the Bilabonnement.dk system.

## How to Use
This service is expected to run as part of a bigger service. To learn more about how to get the service running, check out the README at the [Bilabonnement repository](https://github.com/Christian-Skovgaard/bilAbonnement).

### API Endpoints
The service exposes a RESTful API to manage damage cases stored in the MongoDB database. All endpoints are prefixed with the base path (e.g., `http://localhost:5005`).
